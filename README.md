# CapstoneProject1 â€“ RISC-V RV32IM CPU with TileLink-I2C Bridge

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is the **first phase** of a 3-stage capstone design, focusing on the implementation of a **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU (RV32IM)** with basic peripheral communication through a **TileLink to I2C bridge**.

It is designed for simulation using **Verilator, VCS, and Xcelium**, and serves as the foundation for later phases including **Superscalar extension** and **high-speed USB interface integration**.

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- âœ… Implement a 5-stage pipeline CPU supporting the **RV32IM ISA**.
- âœ… Integrate a minimal **TileLink-UL interface** for memory and peripheral communication.
- âœ… Develop a functional **TileLink-to-I2C bridge** for basic external interfacing.
- âœ… Provide a testbench for verifying core CPU operations and I2C communication.
- âœ… Support simulation using **Verilator** and **industry-standard tools (VCS/Xcelium)**.
